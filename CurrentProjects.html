      <h2>Validation of close-kin mark-recapture</h2>
      <p>Close-kin mark-recapture or CKMR is a cutting-edge technique for
        abundance estimation that makes use of genetic-based kinship assignment.
        The technique is particularly advantageous in situations where sampling
        is sparse, employs a variety of effort levels and methods, and/or
        involves lethal capture. An additional benefit of CKMR is the ability to
        estimate absolute abundance during past years (and potentially past
        decades in long-lived species).</p>
      <p>The basic premise of CKMR is that the occurrence of kin-pairs in a
        sample is directly related to the number of individuals in a population
        and, in particular, the number of mature individuals present during a
        specific year. In a small population, a randomly chosen juvenile and
        adult are fairly likely to be a parent-offspring pair. However, in a
        very large population this likelihood is greatly reduced. By comparing
        all possible combinations within a sample and using genotyping to
        determine how many are true parent-offspring pairs one can calculate the
        most likely size for the true population.</p>
      <p>This technique is quite new and has therefore not been widely applied.
        At present, CKMR has mainly been used to assess a few high-value and/or
        difficult to sample marine stocks (e.g. <a url="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1464105042">southern
          bluefin tuna</a> and <a url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20593-w">white
          sharks</a> ). My work seeks to further validate the technique in
        freshwater systems by employing CKMR to assess salmonid recovery. More
        information on the specific project and our findings is available in the
        published <a url="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.3259">article</a>

      <h2>Community response to colonization and invasion</h2>
      <p>Predation can strongly influence zooplankton community composition,
        both directly and indirectly. While predation by vertebrates such as
        planktivorous fish has often been considered to be the main driver of
        zooplankton community size structure in lakes inhabited by fish, studies
        have shown that predation by larger invertebrates such as larvae of the
        dipteran midge <i>Chaoborus</i> can also exert strong influences on
        zooplankton. Case studies also suggest that shifts towards invertebrate
        predation can increase diversity and average size in zooplankton
        communities. However, predator communities are themselves subject to
        change due to a variety of factors. While many invertebrate predators,
        such as<i> Chaoborus</i>, are not limited by transport due their
        aerially-dispersing adult stages, their distribution may be determined
        by environmental factors such as susceptibility to UV exposure in clear
        lakes. Non-native fish predators and the invasive predatory cladoceran <i>Bythotrephes</i>
        disperse more slowly, but rising human access to remote waters have
        accelerated these potential impacts on lake zooplankton communities.</p>
      <p>We studied the effects of these interacting forces on zooplankton
        community dynamics and overall food web structure using existing
        long-term data on water chemistry, fish abundance, fish isotopic
        composition, and zooplankton biomass in an Adirondack lake formerly
        influenced by acidification and recently invaded by rainbow smelt (<i>Osmerus
          mordax</i>). We augmented this data set by extending analyses to the
        present day, re-analyzing zooplankton samples for<i> Chaoborus</i>, and
        examining the contemporary isotopic food web to enhance our
        understanding of previously collected brook trout isotopic data. The
        goal of our analyses was to answer three interlinked questions: 1) has
        the lakeâ€™s biotic community continued to recover from acidification, 2)
        what effect has the colonization of vertebrate and invertebrate
        zooplankton predators had on zooplankton community composition and 3)
        how has the recovering brook trout population been influenced by these
        changes.</p>

      <h2>Diel interlake movement by white sucker</h2>
      <p>I am currently in the process of investigating diel interlake movement
        by white sucker (<i>Catostomus commersoni</i>). Preliminary data
        indicates that a substantial proportion of the sucker population in an
        interconnected northern lake system moves between waters a nightly basis
        during June and July, leaving one lake at sunset and returning shortly
        before dawn the next morning. Fish repeated this pattern day after day,
        with one individual making 29 similar trips in a 60-day period. While
        not a game species, white suckers are widespread in New York and can
        comprise a significant portion of the fish biomass in many waters. The
        potential for inter-lake movement therefore might have a substantial
        influence on food web linkages in networks of connected lakes and
        streams. This project has been <a url="https://newyork.fisheries.org/newsletter-blog-3-15-17/">
          featured</a> by the New York Chapter of the American Fisheries Society
        and the results are currently in review. </p>

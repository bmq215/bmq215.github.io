      <h2>Boat electrofishing effort metrics</h2>
      <p>Boat electrofishing is often used to obtain an index of abundance known
        as catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). However, the “effort” part of CPUE is
        poorly defined. Early sampling guidelines suggested recording effort in
        both time (e.g. seconds fished) and space (shoreline distance), checking
        both measures for bias, and then using the least-biased metric (Reynolds
        1983). Later works have gone so far as to say that time-based measures
        are inherently biased due to the potential for gear saturation (Bayley
        and Austen 2002). Despite these cautions, time-based measures of effort
        remain widely used.</p>
      <p>Issues with boat electrofishing CPUE arise due to “handling time”, i.e.
        the time necessary to capture each fish. Many survey methods such as
        gill nets or trawls aren’t affected by handling time – any number of
        fish can be caught simultaneously as long as the gear can physically
        accommodate them. However, boat electrofishing works more like
        hook-and-line angling where some measure of time and attention must be
        devoted to each individual fish. When effort is defined in terms of
        time, this has the effect of either adding more time (if survey speeds
        are varied in order to net all stunned fish) or causing fish to be
        missed (if survey speeds are kept constant). Spatial measures of effort,
        on the other hand, can better accommodate variable boat speeds and
        produce an unbiased CPUE metric. This can clearly be seen in the
        simulation below, which shows the effect of handling time on the
        performance of three separate metric-strategy combinations along a range
        of potential densities:</p>
      <p>Our study further explores this dynamic and tests three different
        measures of effort: time fished, shoreline distance fished, and an
        innovative “area fished” measure derived from a custom-built GPS
        tracker. Results clearly indicate that time-based measures of effort
        have the potential to be biased at high catch densities whereas spatial
        metrics are uninfluenced by handling time-related saturation. More

      <h2>Seasonal habitat use by round goby</h2>
      <p>Round goby are one of the fastest spreading introduced fish species in
        North America and are especially a cause for concern within the Great
        Lakes drainage basin. However, their seasonal patterns of habitat usage
        in these new systems have not been thoroughly studied. We used video
        surveys combined with novel statistical approaches (N-mixture
        hierarchical species distribution models) to assess seasonal biomass
        along a depth gradient. Our results suggest that goby habitat usage
        varies drastically between seasons – inhabiting a narrow, shallow band
        during summertime and transitioning to a deep and widely dispersed
        distribution for the winter months. The results from this project have
        been <a url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fwb.13502">published</a>
        in Freshwater Biology. </p>
      <h2>New York Catch Rate Orient Trout Stocking Model (CROTS)</h2>
      <p><img src="Electrofish_1.jpg" style="float:right; padding: 10px" width="40%">
        Stocking fish is a common method of enhancing the perceived recreational
        value of a fishery. In New York, the State Department of Environmental
        Conservation stocks approximately <a url="https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/62477.html">2.3
          million</a> catchable-size trout every year. These
        hatchery-raised fish augment wild populations with the goal of improving
        fishing opportunities. Decisions on where, when, and what to stock are
        made using a population dynamics model that simulates the abundance of
        stocked fish throughout the angling season.</p>
      <p>My work focused on creating and improving New York’s model, which had
        originally been created in the early 1980’s. While the basic structure
        remained valid, many of the parameters relating to angler behavior (e.g.
        rates for release, poaching, etc.), as well as natural causes of
        mortality had changed over the intervening decades. To address these
        changes, I worked with a group of biologists and managers from across
        the state to re-estimate and update the model parameters and structure.
        We accomplished this by conducting a multi-year study of trout waters
        across the state, employing both biological surveys (e.g. multi-pass
        electrofishing) and creel surveys to evaluate the present state of New
        York’s stream trout fisheries. I then used this information to
        re-estimate parameters and test alternative model structures using
        AD-modelbuilder, an open-source software package for non-linear
        statistical modeling. Ultimately, the results of this work were
        submitted as a <a url="https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/fish_marine_pdf/crots.pdf">report</a>
        and have led to the creation of a new 
        <a url="https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/111015.html">inland trout stocking plan</a>.</p>
      <h2>Measurement error in angler creel surveys</h2>
      <p>Estimates of angler catch rates are critical to evaluating the success
        of management efforts such as habitat restoration and stocking. These
        catch rates are often estimated creel surveys or catch cards, where
        anglers are asked to provide information about their catch and effort.
        The catch rates calculated from these responses are then used to
        estimate a mean catch rate, plus or minus some degree of uncertainty as
        to the true catch rate. However, this approach ignores the fact that
        imperfect measurement during data collection may also contribute error
        to this estimate. Anglers may misremember the true amount of time spent
        fishing, misidentify species, or inaccurately estimate sizes. Standard
        estimation techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares Regression do not
        account for this measurement error. In addition, controversy exists over
        whether to use the “mean-of-ratios” (i.e. calculate all individual catch
        rates and then take the mean) or the “ratio-of-means” (i.e. calculate
        the mean catch and the mean effort, then take the ratio of those). We
        tested the performance of both estimators along with four separate
        regression methods and found that results from regression methods which
        took measurement error into account (i.e. “model II” regression) were
        less-biased. Our results also supported using the “ratio-of-means”
        estimator for complete trips (e.g. catch cards) and the “mean-of-ratios”
        estimator for incomplete trips. The full article can be found

      <h2>Sex-specific modeling of summer flounder stocks</h2>
      <p>Summer flounder (also known as fluke) are a commercially and recr
        important species of flatfish found along the East coast of the United
        States and Canada. Like many species, summer flounder are sexually
        dimorphic - females grow faster and to larger sizes - which can lead to
        unequal harvest between sexes. The model currently used by NOAA
        Fisheries does not incorporate sex-specific differences and therefore
        may yield biased population estimates. We worked
        to create a set of alternate models that incorporate sex, length, and
        age. This project was jointly funded by the <a url="http://www.ssfff.net/">
        Save the Summer Flounder Fishery Fund</a> and the 
        <a url="https://scemfis.org/">Science Center for Marine Fisheries</a>.</p>
      <h2>Small-Scale PIT Tag Arrays</h2>
      <p><img src="PIT_Installation_1.jpg" style="float:left; padding: 10px;" width="25%">
        Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags are a commonly used technique
        for identifying and tracking organisms as they are small,
        cost-effective, and can operate indefinitely. These tiny tags take
        advantage of the same technologies as the “chips” used to identify pets,
        the push-button ignition systems that recognize when your car keys are
        present, and the touchless locks used on buildings around the world.
        Since the chip is powered by the magnetic field emitted from the reader,
        it can remain active until it breaks down materially (a very, very long
        time in the case of these glass-encapsulated tags).</p>
      <p>There are two main detection techniques used in fisheries PIT tag
        research: permanent, stream-width detection arrays and portable backpack
        units. The former are very common and capable of identifying nearly all
        tagged organisms passing a particular point on a linear stream system
        but require significant infrastructure to install and maintain. Backpack
        detection units, on the other hand,are more suited to small streams and
        short-term work, but rely on labor-intensive manual surveys for tagged
        organisms that may be disruptive to fish behavior.</p>
      <p>To complement these methods, I developed a technique using multiple,
        independent, small-scale PIT readers. An array of these readers is
        cost-effective and can collect data autonomously. The use of small
        pass-over antennas also allows for placement in nonlinear waterbodies,
        such as lakes and ponds, where travel direction cannot be assumed and
        pass-through antennas are therefore of limited utility. Such a system
        does not replace current methods but instead expands the utility of
        these widely used tags and creates new research opportunities. At
        present, this method has been used to assess brook trout spawning
        behavior in the Adirondacks and has been adopted by the New York State
        Department of Environmental Conservation to assess trout movement in the

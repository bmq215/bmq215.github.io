        Batteries</h1>
      <p>If you’ve done any work involving fishes in streams, estuaries, lakes,
        or really any shallow body of water, you’re probably familiar with the
        Smith-Root LR-20B and LR-24 backpack electrofishers. These
        battery-powered units are used for research and management around the
        world. In addition to being rugged and reliable they include such
        luxuries as safety stops and digital displays.</p>
      <p>Unlike the gas-generator-welded-to-a-packframe constructions that
        preceded them, battery powered electrofishers are quiet, relatively
        light, and easy to maintain. The only drawback is one shared by all
        battery powered equipment. Namely, that batteries don’t last forever. In
        fact, the standard lead-acid battery (the chemistry used in Smith-Root’s
        batteries) lasts for about five years if treated well. Heavy use, deep
        discharges, or long periods without maintenance charging can greatly
        reduce this lifespan. Even newer battery technologies, such as the
        lithium iron phosphate cells that Smith-Root recently introduced, share
        this limitation.</p>
      <p>Beyond wearing out it’s also just convenient to have some spare
        batteries lying around. Whether you’re planning a week-long backpacking
        trip to shock some remote lakes or simply hedging your bets and not
        relying on the last user to charge everything up after they’ve finished
        their work, spare batteries can save your day in the field.</p>
      <p>Smith-Root understands this and, conveniently, sells replacement
        batteries. However, at time of writing the basic 24V 7Ah battery retails
        for about $330.00USD. This isn’t much of a problem if you’ve got good
        funding, but for a grad student, a small lab, or a group doing
        educational outreach, $300 can be a lot of money. Luckily, it turns out
        that there’s a way around this.</p>
      <p>A little while ago, one of my colleagues asked me to take a look at an
        old Smith-Root backpack electrofisher and batteries that they’d
        inherited from another group. The electrofisher was fine but the
        batteries were, predictably, shot. After taking a closer look I realized
        that each battery is simply made from a handful of off-the-shelf parts,
        a little glue, and a bit of solder. How much do these parts cost? About
        $30 for a standard battery and closer to $40 for a 24V 12A extended life
        battery ($388USD retail, at time of writing).</p>
      <h2>Construction</h2>
      <p>Each Smith-Root backpack electrofisher battery (for either the LR-24 or
        LR-20B) supplies 24 volts and has a capacity of either 7 amp-hours or 12
        amp-hours (for the extended life version). With the exception of the new
        lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) technology, these batteries use sealed
        lead-acid (SLA) cells that require no maintenance beyond regular
        charging. Now 24V is a little unusual in the general lead-acid battery
        market (most are 12V) but, as you may recall from basic physics, wiring
        two batteries together in series adds their respective voltages. If we
        do this to two 12V cells we’ll end up with a 24V and, as you can see
        from the picture, that’s exactly what Smith-Root has done.</p>
      <p><img src="SmithRoot_Battery_1.png" style=" 
        margin-top: 10px; float:right; margin-left: 10px" width="50%"> In fact,
        the Smith-Root batteries are simply two commercially available SLA
        batteries glued to a plastic handle and wired in series. This handle is
        nothing more than a 0.25″ thick sheet of ABS plastic with a hole routed
        in it for a handle and a spot for the power connectors. Since the
        battery cases are also made of ABS plastic, it’s possible to create very
        strong glue joints between the three components. The only remaining
        pieces are the fancy orange connector between the center (-) and (+)
        terminals which turns out to be a 40A automotive fuse (MAXI size), and
        the connectors that attach the battery to the electrofisher. These
        connectors are known as Anderson Powerpoles and have a rather rather
        cool stackable, genderless design. They can be bought for about a dollar
        apiece from a number of different hardware supply websites.</p>
      <p>First you need to source two 12V SLA batteries in either the 7A or 12A
        size (you can go with other sizes too, all you’re changing is the
        fishing time). There are actually a few competing brands for these, all
        with pretty much the exact same range of sizes and quality. The only
        real difference between brands is the color of the casing. Smith-Root
        appears to use AJC batteries but Sigmastek (which I’ve used here) or
        Powersonic will also work. AJC simply refers to the batteries by voltage
        and amperage (so 12V 7A or 12V 12A) while Sigmastek calls them SP12-7
        and SP12-12 and Powersonic labels them the PS1270 and PS12120. All are
        equivalent so I recommend shopping around for the best deal. </p>
      <p>Once you’ve done that you need to collect the other pieces. I’ve had
        good success getting 12″x48″ sheets of 0.25″ ABS plastic from Grainger
        (which will make a lot of batteries) and the other components can be
        obtained from McMaster-Carr. The Powerpole connectors should be the 45A
        size and I recommend getting the combined housing and connector kits. By
        mixing a five-part red kit with a similar black one you get enough
        connectors to make five batteries. Finally you’ll need the
        aforementioned 40A MAXI fuse, some 8AWG wire in red and black, and some
        heat-shrink tubing to protect the terminals. </p>
      <p><img src="Battery_Handle_1.png" style=" 
        margin-top: 10px; float:left; margin-right: 10px" width="50%">The next
        step is to cut down your ABS sheet until you’ve got a chunk about 6″ by
        5.5″. I did this on a bandsaw but a jigsaw, scroll saw, or even a
        hacksaw would work just as well. If you’d like to be fancy you can add
        the rounded corned at this time, although it’d certainly not necessary
        for normal operation. I’ve found that a coarse file works well for
        cleaning up any rough edges and doing final shaping.</p>
      <p>After that’s done it’s time to cut out the rounded handle slot. In all
        honesty, you could skip this step completely (and the handle itself, for
        that matter) but it’s nice to have when you’re carrying the battery
        around and provides a place to run the strap when securing the battery
        to the electrofisher. I tried a few different ways of making this,
        including a dremel, but finally settled on a combination of a hole saw
        (for the rounded ends) and a keyhole saw (for the straight areas between
        them) with a bit of filing to finish up. A jigsaw or scroll saw would
        probably work well too.</p>
      <p><img src="Battery_Glue_1.png" style=" 
        margin-top: 10px; float:right; margin-left: 10px" width="50%"> At this
        point I recommend testing the fit to make sure that everything lines up,
        especially the fuse in its little slot. Then, if you’re happy with how
        it all goes together it’s time to get out the glue and set about making
        it permanent. I have no idea what Smith-Root uses but I went with
        Weld-On 16, namely because I had some lying around. Any glue that’s
        suitable for ABS plastic should work fine as we’re not doing anything
        exotic like joining dissimilar materials. Once you’re got that all set
        up it’s time to clamp it and step away for 24 hours or so.</p>
      <p><img src="Battery_Complete_1.jpg" style=" 
        margin-top: 10px; float:left; margin-right: 10px" width="50%"> After the
        glue sets, all that’s left is to solder the fuse across the middle two
        tabs (linking the batteries in series and adding their voltages to make
        a 24V unit) and then solder the wires to the two remaining outside tabs.
        Connect the matching color Powerpole connectors to the end of each wire
        and you have yourself a battery unit that’s 100% compatible with both
        LR-24/LR-20B units and the battery chargers associated with them.</p>
      <p>Feel free to email with any questions or comments. I’m especially
        interested in hearing from anyone who’s built one of these and would
        love to see pictures of the finished product.</p>
      <p>Update Sept. 2019: I’ve heard from a few people interested in whether
        this technique can be used to make replacements for Smith-Root 24V 9.6AH
        lithium batteries and the answer is yes, this definitely works for those
        too. You’ll just need to buy LiFePO4 SLA replacements which are
        available from many of the same suppliers selling regular SLA batteries.
        These tend to run in the $100-150 range for ~9.6AH so two will run you
        around $300, a far cry from the $997 Smith-Root currently charges. The
        only additional wrinkle is that Smith-Root’s lithium models use a 6-pin
        powerpole connector instead of the normal two and come with a 6-to-2 pin
        adapter that allows you to connect the battery to their electrofishers
        and chargers. This is entirely due to shipping regulations: if the two
        batteries were permanently connected they would have to be re-certified
        as a “new” battery. Instead, Smith-Root runs all four battery terminals
        to the connector (the extra two are just for show) and then
        uses the adapter to connect them in series. This allows them to rely on
        the original certification for the batteries and avoid regulatory
        hassles. If you’re not going to ship your homemade batteries you can
        simply follow the 2-pin instructions above or you can use a multimeter
        to figure out the terminal order that Smith-Root uses and go with 6-pin
        connectors (although you’ll need to acquire or make 6-to-2 pin adapters
        if you go this route).</p>
      <p>Disclaimer: I’m not a professional engineer nor am I in any way
        associated with Smith-Root. This worked for me but I can’t guarantee
        that it will for you.</p>

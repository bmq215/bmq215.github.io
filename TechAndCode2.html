      <h1>Fish Finder Bathymetry</h1>
      <p>Bathymetry, the underwater equivalent of topography, is an important
        component of any aquatic research. Whether one is simply trying to
        determine the deepest spot in a waterbody or working on something much
        more complex, such as flow modeling, an accurate understanding of the
        underwater terrain is required. Traditionally creating bathymetric maps
        was an extremely time consuming process, requiring many hours of depth
        sounding and position measurement as well as a skilled cartographer.
        Today this is done with multibeam sonar and advanced data processing
        that can create high resolution maps in a fraction of the time.</p>
      <p>The equipment necessary to accomplish this, however, is specialized and
        expensive. Since such studies usually only need to be done once they are
        generally contracted out to specialized consulting firms. Unfortunately,
        the high prices that such firms charge are often out of the reach of
        smaller research and management groups.</p>
      <p>One solution to this problem is a hybrid approach that combines the
        traditional approach of many single-point depth soundings with modern
        technology and statistical analyses. While not as high resolution as
        multibeam sonar, this technique can provide accurate bathymetric maps at
        a fraction of the cost.</p>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>Our particular unit, a Humminbird 597ci HD, was left over from another
        project and therefore a very cost-effective choice. While this unit
        retails for around $400 new, a quick check online reveals that there are
        many different fish finders compatible with this approach. The key
        requirements are a built-in GPS, and a NMEA0183 output. Any fish finder
        with both of those features should output the necessary data.</p>
      <p>The data logger consists of a single circuit board that receives the
        NMEA0183 signal, translates it into a format that can be read by an
        onboard microcontroller, and then writes that data to a SD memory card
        in text format. A single LED illuminated button is used to activate the
        logger and provide feedback when recording points. Point acquisition is
        determined by straight-line distance from the last recorded
        point, but could alternately be based upon time, speed, surface
        temperature, or a combination of factors. For our work the
        microcontroller is programmed to record a point every five meters.</p>
      <p>Both the data logger and its power source, two AA batteries, are housed
        in a small plastic enclosure and connected to the fish finder through a
        removable data cable (purchased from the manufacturer). This allows one
        to disconnect the logger from the fish finder when not actively engaged
        in mapping. While I havenâ€™t extensively tested the battery life of the
        unit, calculations and field observations suggest that two alkaline AA
        batteries should be sufficient for well over 100 hours of mapping.</p>

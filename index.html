    <h1>About me</h1>
		<p> <img src="Spotlight%20Pic%20BenMQ.png" style="margin-top: 10px; float:left; margin-right: 10px" width="20%"> </p>
		<p> I’m a Postdoctoral Associate studying freshwater ecology in the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/rsenr/profiles/ellen_marsden">Marsden Lab</a> at the
        University of Vermont's <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/rsenr/rubensteinlab">Rubenstein
          Ecosystem Science Laboratory</a>. My research focuses on the use of quantitative
        methods and population genetics to assess restoration of lake trout in
        Lake Champlain. In my free time, I’m also a hiker, skier, beekeeper, and
        occasional dabbler in electronic design. </p>
		<p> Prior to starting at UVM, I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. from Cornell
        University where I studied fisheries population dynamics in response to
        anthropogenic disturbances as part of the <a href="http://www2.dnr.cornell.edu/cek7/afrp_index.htm">Adirondack
          Fishery Research Program</a>. </p>

		<h2>Assessing wild lake trout recruitment using close-kin mark-recapture</h2>
			<p> Effective fisheries management and restoration requires reliable estimates of abundance and population trajectories through time. 
			However, absolute population estimates are extremely difficult to obtain in large systems due to the prohibitively high sample sizes required by most approaches. 
			Close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) is a new technique that can obviate this hurdle by using the observed kinship within a sample to estimate the true adult abundance. 
			We are developing a CKMR model for lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) in Lake Champlain in order to evaluate the size of the parental population contributing to the 
			recently-observed (and much celebrated) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2017.11.006">wild recruitment</a>. 
			In addition to providing information for managing Champlain’s population, the resulting analysis pipeline will be designed with enough flexibility for 
			application to other systems and species.</p>
		<h2>Lake trout stocking performance in Lake Champlain</h2>
			<p>Despite evidence of sustained wild recruitment, Lake Champlain’s lake trout population in still primarily a stocked fishery. 
			While the drivers behind the recent recruitment success are unknown, shifts favoring the survival of wild fish could similarly affect stocked juveniles, 
			suggesting that the current stocking strategies may produce different results than they have in the past. Until 2022, Champlain was stocked with ~82,000 fish 
			annually that came from either New York (33% of total, “Seneca strain” fish stocked at age-1 in the spring) or Vermont (66% of total, “Champlain strain” fish 
			stocked at age-0 in the fall). With the onset of wild recruitment this stocking has been adjusted downwards by eliminating the New York portion. 
			However, the relative survival and performance of the two stocking components are unknown. We designed a sequencing-based genetic marker panel to identify the 
			origin of stocked fish in the lake. In combination with an archived tissue samples from 2000+ fish and maxillary aging, we are conducting a mixed-stock analysis 
			in order to inform future stocking adjustments.</p>
		<h2>Burbot population structure using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing</h2>
			<p>Burbot (<i>Lota lota</i>) is the only freshwater cod and inhabits cold lakes and rivers throughout the northern hemisphere. 
			The species is likely an important component of the food web in many systems, but little is known about the current status of most populations. 
			Because burbot require cool (<25&#176;C) water and are not especially mobile they are especially vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and climate change. 
			In Lake Champlain, there is concern that the construction of several causeways in the 1800s has isolated fish between the five main basins, 
			potentially splitting the population into several parts. We are investigating this dynamic using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to 
			evaluate population structure and estimate the contemporary effective population size.</p>
